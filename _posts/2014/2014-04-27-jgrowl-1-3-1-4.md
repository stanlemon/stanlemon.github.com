About a week ago I released v1.3 of [jGrowl](https://github.com/stanlemon/jGrowl). This is for all intents and purposes a maintenance release, containing primarily packing info for npm and bower, as well as a Grunt config for future development. More importantly is that the '_develop_' branch is underway and this contains some significant changes to the plugin.

The 1.4 release intends to address the following things:

*   _LESS_ for CSS
*   Remove IE6 support
*   Easily use [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) and include examples

These things are currently available for testing, simply pull 'develop' and give it a spin.

Additionally I am very happy to share that the [jGrowl package on Bower](http://bower.io/search/?q=jgrowl) now points at the correct repository, meaning you can easily add jGrowl to your project using this excellent package manager.

Lastly, while most of the development on 1.4 is complete I am hoping at some point to work on automating some tests of the plugin. If you have experience doing this with jQuery plugins I would welcome advice, insight or better yet - pull requests.  If you have any feedback on either 1.3 or 1.4 please don't hesitate to drop me a line.
