I recently decided to signup for [Pley](http://pley.com), a service that supplies lego sets by mail for a monthly membership price.  They advertise that you're safe to lose a piece or two and that the kits are always sanitary using their special _FDA grade_ process.  Unfortunately I found both of these claims to be **false**.

First off let's set the record straight, I'm an adult Lego geek. That's a technical term, you can check me on it. As a kid I had a vast array of sets and spent countless hours constructing my dreams. Then I went to High School, College and got married and had mostly forgotten about Legos.  Until I took a job where I was working on the hosting infrastructure used by the Official Lego Podcasts, like [this one](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/lego-hero-factory-channel/id372652372?mt=2).  Suddenly I had an excuse to play with Legos again, it was work related after all...

I've collected a few sets as an adult, and I fully admit to playing with them from time to time.  _I'm not ashamed._ When I saw Pley I thought it could be the perfect _life-as-a-service_ for my late night hobby.

I went through the trial and the first set I got was a total bust. The [Desert Skiff](http://shop.lego.com/en-US/Desert-Skiff-9496) came in the mail and I started piecing it together.  Normally I try to avoid the directions as much as possible, as that adds to the general fun of the puzzle.  But on this one though I had to pull out the book. This probably sounds a little crazy since it's only a 213 piece set, but hear me out. As it turns out the set was missing pieces, to the tune of at least 10! I finally couldn't finish the set because there were so many missing. I logged online an reported the missing pieces and sent the set back in.  I admit that out of frustration I didn't pull everything apart. I hadn't heard back from Pley until this week when they sent this email to me.

I'm a little more than flabbergasted. I didn't get any replies when I filed a missing-part list! On their website they say, _"Lost a piece? No worries. We won't charge."_ What they don't say is, "The next guy might be out of luck though!" Furthermore, if their process is so clean how did this kid _Tal_ get the set still stuck together? How do they know I didn't stick a booger between those blocks?  And really what are they doing sending this kid's letter to me? Surely this is some kind of privacy violation!

The thing I really miscalculated though was thinking that renting one set at a time would somehow pacify my burning desire as a Lego-master to mix and match multiple sets. There simply is nothing better than owning your sets, period.

Unfortunately I just can't recommend this service.  Yeah, it's partially out of bitterness, but I also feel like I've been lied to. So keep buying on Amazon, or Target or wherever it is you get your Lego-fix and steer clear of Pley!
