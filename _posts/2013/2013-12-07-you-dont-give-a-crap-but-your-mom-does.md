_So you don’t give a crap that your data gets exposed or hacked?_ You don’t have anything to hide, so the potential leak isn’t worth the added effort of complex passwords and password management systems.  You want a simple, easy to remember password.  Fair enough.  I get it.  You don’t give a crap, but here’s the thing… **Your mom might.** Or your dad, or your sister or your great Aunt Bertha or your Cousin’s best friend that you just recently added on Facebook.  _And that’s the point_!

Let’s say you’re one of the few who don’t give a rip because you have nothing to hide. Stop being selfish!  Most of this password protection junk has nothing to do with you.  It has to do with the information you have access to, like my email address, my phone number, the names of my kids and that picture I shared with you from my best friends bachelor party!

You are most likely passively collecting information in the services you use every day.  It might just be people's names, but it also could be more serious information like their addresses and phone numbers.  A data leak because you used a stupid password exposes all kinds of things that your friends and family don’t want everyone under the sun to know. And not just because it’s private information, but because it effects their safety!

It can get worse then just the revealing of address and phone numbers though.  How you say?  Consider the fact that that Facebook app on your phone posts where you go.  Maybe it’s a restaurant, church or even the grocery store.  You’re a hip social media rock star and you’ve been capturing your geo-coordinates and checking in wherever you go.  So have I, your mutual friend on Facebook,  as well as your neighbor’s 16 year old daughter.  Now ALL of that information about where you’ve been and the trends of your daily activity is accessible to some low life hacker that cracked your stupid-simple password.  Is this sounding scary yet?  Let’s keep going…  That hacker might decide to pay one of us (you, me or or your neighbor’s teenage daughter) a visit.  Or maybe the hacker sells that valuable data information to a petty thief or a pedophile. Now is it scary? _It ought to be_.  **This is what happens when the flood gate known as your weakly protected account is opened.**

You are just a gateway drug for a hacker. Your credit card, social security number are low hanging fruit compared to the peripheral data you are toting in those web based accounts you login day in and day out. Protecting your accounts with unique and complex passwords isn’t just about you.  It’s about everyone you engage with using those services.  It’s about personal protection, for you, your family and your friends. So I get it, you don’t have anything to hide that you’re worried about a hacker exposing. But I do.
