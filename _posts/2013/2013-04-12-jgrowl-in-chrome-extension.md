The other day someone on StackOverflow asked how to integrate [jGrowl](http://github.com/stanlemon/jGrowl) into a Chrome extension.  They had a pretty good start, but missed some important details.  I've uploaded a complete working Chrome extension with jGrowl to Github as part of my response to the question.

The question can be found here: [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15870797/jgrowl-issue-in-chrome-extension](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15870797/jgrowl-issue-in-chrome-extension)

The GitHub repository with the example implementation can be found here: [https://github.com/stanlemon/jgrowl-chrome-ext](https://github.com/stanlemon/jgrowl-chrome-ext)
