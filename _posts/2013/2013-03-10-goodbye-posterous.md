Unfortunately as I predicted when Posterous was bought, the product is dying. It's going to get shutdown soon and that leaves those of us who loved it searching for something instead. It's a bummer, but I don't blame Twitter. Rather, I blame the CEO of Posterous and its investors for creating a fantastic product with no way to make money on it. More and more this seems to be the story of Silicon Startups and it really kind of stinks. I find myself at this juncture wanting my next blog solution to be portable and Wordpress seems to fit that ticket. I'm tired of hosting a blog, that's why I went to Posterous in the first place. The fact that Wordpress has a good mobile presence is also a win in my book. So I am going to give this a shot and see what happens.
