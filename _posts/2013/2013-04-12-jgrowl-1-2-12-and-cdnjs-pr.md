As promised, with 100+ stargazers on GitHub [I've submitted a pull request](https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs/pull/1167) to [cdnjs](http://cdnjs.com) from [CloudFare](https://www.cloudflare.com) for [jGrowl](http://github.com/stanlemon/jGrowl). Before doing so I made a minor release update to jGrowl. There are no functional changes in 1.2.12, however I did improve the README to include documentation on the various configuration options and I also added a compressed version of the library with a source map.  If you don't know what a source map is [I suggest you google it](https://www.google.com/search?q=javascript+source+map), because they're pretty awesome.
