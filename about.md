My name is Stan Lemon, I am a [husband](https://saralemon.com), dad, Steelers fan and software developer.

My [wife](https://saralemon.com) and I live in Indianapolis, Indiana with our three kids. Â I studied Theology and Biblical Languages at Concordia University River Forest, where I received a Bachelor of Arts degree.  After college I shifted gears and took up software development and that's how I've been making a living ever since.  When I'm not working I enjoy spending time with my kids, reading Star Wars books and watching the [Pittsburgh Steelers](https://steelers.com).

I built an *iOS/watchOS/iPadOS/macOS* app for my family called [Dollar & Sense](http://dollarandsense.app), which we use to track chores and our kids savings. I enjoy hacking away at it during my nights and weekends. You can download it on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dollar-sense/id1631766637?itsct=apps_box_badge&itscg=30200), and it's completely free.

For a few years you could catch me every week with my friend [Jon Kohlmeir](http://jonkohlmeier.net/about/) on our podcast, [Life with a Twist of Lemon](http://twistoflemonpod.com).

My [LinkedIn profile](http://linkedin.com/in/stanlemon) includes my work history and what I'm currently up to.

You can find some of my past projects over on [GitHub](http://github.com/stanlemon).

I volunteer as a Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) in Marion County through [Kid's Voice](https://www.kidsvoicein.org).
