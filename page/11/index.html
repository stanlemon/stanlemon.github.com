  <hr>

  <p>I recently read Richard Miller's post  <a href="http://richardmiller.co.uk/2014/03/12/avoiding-setter-injection/">Avoiding Setter Injection</a> and I in large part agree with his sentiments. My conversion to constructor injection over setter injection is a fairly recent one and when I was initially deliberating the differences I found a lot of explanations online with little concrete code to show why this practice is less productive to good object oriented design. I thought I would try to illustrate with some concrete code examples I agree with Miller that ultimately constructor injection is a more worthy approach and why you should avoid using setter injection whenever possible.</p>
<p>First, let's consider two interfaces <em>FooService</em> and <em>FooNotifier. FooService</em> will use a <em>FooNotifier</em> which contains a method <em>notify().</em> We have two implementations of <em>FooNotifier</em> the <em>BarNotifier</em> and the <em>BazNotifier.</em>  Fundamentally they do two completely different things, though they agree to the same contract.  Here's what these things look like:</p>
<p>[gist]https://gist.github.com/stanlemon/d0748c96775995275074[/gist]</p>
<p>Now let's take a look at our constructor injection implementation <em>FooServiceConstruct</em>:</p>
<p>[gist]https://gist.github.com/stanlemon/a1968eedabb808fa5985[/gist]</p>
<p>And also our setter injection implementation <em>FooServiceSetter</em>:</p>
<p>[gist]https://gist.github.com/stanlemon/4ca097db323de8c7faba[/gist]</p>
<p>The argument goes that with constructor injection you create an object with all of it's dependencies. This means that you minimize side effects caused by the dependency not being injected, or worse changing on you after your object has been created. It makes your object fundamentally more predictable. Think of it this way, this is the only way that we can use our <em>FooServiceConstruct</em>:</p>
<p>[gist]https://gist.github.com/stanlemon/f2cf4b13562fa1fa3f74[/gist]</p>
<p>But with _FooServiceSetter w_e can actually do a couple of things with that implementation...</p>
<p>[gist]https://gist.github.com/stanlemon/bcd6e243a4baa5d7b0f5[/gist]</p>
<p>You'll see that we can create a <em>FooService</em> that either does not work or that can have it's internal behavior completely changed out from under us.  Neither of these options is good. The alternative is that with constructor injection we have an object that stands on it's own, the functionality of which cannot be changed in runtime after it has been instantiated. If you want to avoid buggy software, make your objects predictable.</p>
<p>This is a simple example, but it illustrates the nature of an object that uses setter injection. It creates the potential for volatility in your object that you don't want to occur.  Now I'm not saying you should never inject via setter. There may be times that you actually want the behavior I've illustrated, however I think you will find that most of the time you simply don't want that. Subsequently as a general rule I inject by constructor unless compelled otherwise during the design of my software. I make it the exception, not the rule when writing objects.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>For awhile now I've wished that <a href="http://atlassian.com/software/bamboo">Bamboo</a> had an app, or something that could deliver a push notification when a build starts or finishes. Sure there is email, but that means my build notifications will get lost in all of the other junk I am quietly ignoring in my inbox.  What I want is a targeted notification for my builds. So I got to thinking, why not leverage <a href="http://pushover.net">Pushover</a>?</p>
<p>I decided to setup some inline script tasks on one of my bamboo plans using the following code (supply your credentials accordingly), in order to give Bamboo push notifications.</p>
<p>https://gist.github.com/stanlemon/8726494</p>
<p>Of course you can kick this up a notch by changing the message, using additional variables and throwing other notifications in at very stages of your build plans.</p>

  <p>I use Atlassian's <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo">Bamboo</a> for continuous integration on a lot of projects. I'm a huge fan, it's a solid product with a lot of flexibility and the OnDemand service coupled with EC2 instances and custom EBS volume make for a really robust cloud based solution to continuous integration. Almost every project I put into Bamboo involves a call to load <a href="https://getcomposer.org">composer</a> and install dependencies. Many of the projects I dabble with belong to other people and so they're locked down with some form of authentication and not normally in <a href="http://packagist.org">Packagist</a>. In the past this has created some challenges with installing my composer dependencies, but this past weekend I think I finally found a tolerable solution to my dilemma.</p>
<p>In addition to being a big fan of Atlassian's Bamboo I also really like Atlassian <a href="http://bitbucket.org">Bitbucket</a>. I became a heavy Bitbucket user back before Atlassian bought the product because I was a heavy Mercurial user and it was the only hosted solution available. When they were bought and added <em>git</em> I kept using them because they offer <strong>free</strong> private repositories, whereas competitor GitHub does not. I've had problems when I develop a private package and then want to use it in an application. My workaround up until this weekend was to create a &quot;deployment&quot; user and give them access to my private repository, finally including it's username/password on my vas url in the repository block of my composer.json. This is all sorts of ugly and I have never been satisfied with it. In addition to not being safe or secure it also chews up one of the sacred five users you can team up with on a private repository.</p>
<p>So this weekend I set out to find a different approach to private Bitbucket packages in composer. One that wasn't so ugly and didn't make me feel so insecure about my setup.</p>
<p>BitBucket (and GitHub for that matter) have this concept of a deployment key. It's a private/public ssh key combination that grants read-only access to your repository without chewing up a user account to do so.  It's specifically geared toward the problem I was trying to solve. In my case Bamboo executes it's tasks as the 'bamboo' user.  The trick is getting the private portion of your deployment key into a place that Bamboo can use it.  Bamboo OnDemand creates EC2 instances when it needs to run a build and then terminates it after its done.  This is great because it keeps costs low and it means you don't have to worry about a machine getting gunked up with stuff between builds. It also means there's no shared state between runs, so sticking a private key on your EC2 instance only helps you for a little while.  But wait a minute... what if I set that up with a task in my job when it runs?</p>
<p>I wound up creating an initial task to setup my private deployment key like this:</p>
<p>[gist]https://gist.github.com/stanlemon/8661196[/gist]</p>
<p>Fortunately Bamboo lets you lock down your user's ability to see these sort of things and the logs don't show anything indicating what's going on, which makes it relatively secure - at least seemingly more so than sticking a plain text password in my composer.json file.</p>
<p>Now if you're familiar with Bamboo at all you know that the initial repository setup does not allow you to clone using ssh. This is limited only to the Java implementation of git that Bamboo uses to poll the repository. The default EC2 images ship with a full first class git, and so that means if you declare your package in the repositories block like &quot;<em>git@bitbucket.org:team/project.git</em>&quot; it'll use the aforementioned key and load just fine.</p>
<p>Life is a lot easier with an on-premise install of Bamboo where your disk persists between builds and you can set that key up permanently, but for those of us living in the cloud this will do the trick. You can use this approach on-premise too though and you can even use it with Jenkins if that's your preferred continuous integration implementation.</p>

      </h2>
    </div>
    <h4 class="article-date">Dec 22, 2013</h4>
  </div>

  <hr>

  <p>On Thursday, December 20th I decided to deactivate my Facebook account. In full disclosure I am not committed to leaving it deactivated forever. I made this move against the recommendation of my wife and closest friends. Nonetheless I have committed to being Facebook-free for the remainder of 2013.</p>
<p>The question remains, why? Rather then let acquaintances, connections and dare I say “friends” (all supposed 918 of you) speculate I figured it would be best to set the record straight.</p>
<p>I was an early adopter of Facebook, having jumped on the bandwagon in 2005 while I was still studying at school. At the time the appeal for me was to connect with my high school friends, none of which were going to the same school I was. My Junior year of High School morphed into my Senior year and I got out of West Chicago Community High School in three years instead of the normal four. This meant that the group of individuals I had grown up with I was no longer graduating with. Facebook helped me stay connected with some of those people I grew up with and also find out what I had missed my would-be senior year.</p>
<p>I didn’t get heavily involved in posting until 2009 when my daughter Lucy was born. The months leading up to her entrance in the world were filled with posts and pictures of me and my baby-momma packing the pounds and preparing for our daughter’s big appearance. By that point my Facebook friends had expanded to include church friends, neighbors, colleagues from work and college friends as well. So Facebook became a great way to share with them what was going on as a young couple with a growing family.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2013, eight years after I first setup my account and here I am deactivating it for the first time ever. I’ve longer surpassed Dunbar’s number with regards to my friend count and it’s always been on my mind that many of these connections simply don’t matter. But some of them do. Some of them matter a lot.</p>
<p>I have tried in larger part to resist the urge to discuss politics on Facebook. If you’ve met me in person you know that I am more than willing to share my positions and defend them, and have a reasonable conversation about them. For the most part, I don’t do that on Facebook. Likewise, religion is another topic I do my best to steer away from. This area I have been more gray with though, especially as of late. Please don’t misunderstand me, I have expressed my faith and frequently share things from the Higher Things website. But you won’t find me sharing my beliefs on what I consider to be polarizing social topics. It’s not that I don’t have those beliefs, I do - and as my closest friends will tell you I’m pretty passionate about them too. (Systematic and liturgical theology, the things that most of the world doesn't care about are another story - those I've largely considered fair game for better or worse.)</p>
<p>I consider it a matter of pride that what you get when you talk to me is the same whether it be by text, email, phone or in person. I try very hard to maintain the same level of sarcasm and crassness whether in person or by email. I outright refuse to take myself too seriously on any of these mediums either. This is not a standard I believe to be common though, and I think these medium allow many to hide behind their keyboard and says things in ways they simply would never do in person.</p>
<p>People are very much entitled to their opinions. They are equally entitled to post them on Facebook (or Twitter or the flavor of the day). I’m not getting off Facebook because I don’t want people to speak what they believe or think. If you need to, please read that sentence one more time. I’m getting off of Facebook because I still want to have dinner with you. It dawned on me this week as I watched close friends and immediate family openly criticize my faith in an offensive and personal fashion. I think they thought it was cute, perhaps even comical. I think stupidity prevailed over judgment and they didn’t think it was nearly as awful as it was. Here’s the thing that got me though, none of the people who circulated the meme in question would dare say such things at the Christmas dinner table. They just wouldn’t. It’s in large part because they are decent and kind individuals who love me as much as I love them. Yet on Facebook for whatever reason they seem compelled to cross that line boldly. I’m sure it’s in part because they have friends who are going to hit that “Like” button, or perhaps give them a “True dat!” in the comment feed. But I think they forget that I’m their friend too.</p>
<p>I really enjoy seeing pictures of friends and family. I love hearing about your trips and weekend travels. The recipes you share are not only delicious but inspiring. The posts you make that you’d never be willing to say to my face… those trouble me. They hurt. And I guess that’s ultimately what has driven me away from Facebook. My feelings have been hurt and it’s been done in the shadows of the dark alleys of my Facebook feed. I'm sure others feelings have been hurt to, maybe even by some who agreed with you on your last rant but find this just as offensive as I do.</p>
<p>Growing up my dad would often tell me that “every action has an equal and opposite reaction.” For much of my childhood I wrote this off as just another stanza in the long ballad of life. As an adult I realize there’s a lot of truth and wisdom in such a statement. I guess the reaction then to those friends I mentioned earlier is this… You don’t get to see pictures of my kids at Christmas. You’re not going to get to see the videos on my wall as they open the presents you sent. You’re going to miss next week’s sonogram. And when it comes to that Christmas Wossel recipe we were going to re-share, well you’re out of luck there too. It's pretty tasty by the way.</p>
<p>I don’t know if this is forever… I’ve got the unusual occasion to take time off at Christmas (for first time in four years) and I felt my time might be best spent focussing on my kids than on Facebook. I guess we’ll have to wait and see what’s in store for 2014.</p>
